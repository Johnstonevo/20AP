  <summary>Maqaroon & Cute Life Hacks is a place where girls can get creative inspiration, DIY ideas and good life advice without the glorification of money, beauty or body image.

Hello! I'm Joanna Zhou, a professional illustrator/designer based in Austria. My dream is to inspire girls to live creatively and develop ambitions for work and business. I believe all girls should build their self-confidence based on their intelligence & creativity instead of defining themselves by their appearance. I like fashion as much as everyone but at the end of the day, our looks are only temporary. Focusing on inner skills that grow with time is what will truly make you happy!

  <summary>Welcome to my channel!! I offer inexpensive "do-it-yourself" (DIY) home decor projects that you can easily follow to create or makeover items that will look high-end. I personally love having high-end classy pieces in my home but I don't always want to pay a lot of money for it. I'm sure you can relate to that.

I've dedicated myself to help inspire YOU to believe in YOUR abilities and step out of your comfort zone. Everything you see is done solo while having a full time job.

I am not a professional interior designer or decorator. So, if I can do it, you can too! We all have something special.

A New Video Is Uploaded Every Tuesday at 6:30 AM EST! I hope you enjoy the channel and decide to be apart of the family :-)

Let's keep inspiring each other...XoXo..... Tresha J. A.

  <summary>I designed this channel to help others learn and enjoy the art of woodcarving. I've been a woodcarver for many years and always have had a love for art of any kind but have had to learn without teachers. So I thought I'd present some tips and help to those who don't have access to carving instruction where they live.  I hope the information is helpful and rewarding to those that view it and maybe in my own way keep this wonderful art alive for the next generation .. thanks for subscribing and your input....Kevin</summary>

  <summary>Been a woodcarver for 15 years and love it ..
My interest is teaching this wonderful old art to the youth of today and anyone who wants to learn ...

Woodcarving is a art as old as the beginning of time .. Jesus himself was a carpenter and woodcarver ..Today it is more of a hobbby then a profession .. but still loved by those who continue to perserve the art .. My love of style is flat plane carving .. a style originated in Europe ( mostly Sweden)by most of the figure carvers of that time.. it's distinct characteristics are using  basically only a knife and leaving  the cuts in the figure when finished rather then smooth it out ..
Anyone can learn to carve with the right instruction  .. These videos are meant to help the beginner see how knife carving is done with a variety of projects .. And learn the fun of carving a figure out of wood and other projects ..

So put down the joy sticks, turn off the cell phones , put up the video games  and turn off the music and learn to work with your hands ..</summary>
