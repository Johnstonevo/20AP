  <summary>I have been working with wood since I could stumble into the shop with my dad. A few years ago I moved into a house with no space for a full shop so I decided to take up all hand tool wood working. That started a whole new passion for wood. Now I feel as though I am learning the art all over again.

My Joy and desire is to share this passion for hand tool woodworking with everyone I can. So come along for the fun of learning the ancient and new art of Hand tool woodworking!</summary>

  <summary>Useful & interesting woodworking & maker projects as well as techniques that are designed to be not just cost effective but also interesting, fun and achievable.
Weather you're a "time-served master craftsman" or "weekend hobbyist" - I hope you are entertained and inspired to get out there and build - whilst having fun and feeling proud of your endeavours.
Some videos could be a 'how-to" style, some might just be a "sit back and enjoy the build". Wood, plastic, maybe a bit of metal working.  There could also be some paper or leathercraft. I just like to build, make, create and have fun. You might even enjoy a bit of soldering and some electronics, CNC or 3D printing. I enjoy making so you can enjoy watching - Hopefully  :-)
Watch, like, subscribe, share, watch again! Comments welcomed, questions answered, If you take the time to engage, the least I can do is respond or reply in some way, if only to say thanks for the comment!</summary>

  <summary>Hello dear visitor!
This channel contains some of my work,
i have a degree as a woodworker since 2009, And i hope you will enjoy my videos!

Besides sharing knowledge, one of my goals i hope to achieve by making video's is bringing also a calming experience.
I find it very hard to rush while editing a video, probably because i'm having trouble absorbing to much information myself.
If someone finds the video's relaxing/calming and insightfull, that makes it more worth for me than just giving the information.</summary>

  <summary>I am an obsessed DIYer and Woodworker. I'm not professional or have any training, so I just pick the project I want to tackle and figure it out step by step.

I picked up my first tool in January of 2013. I couldn't afford to buy the things I wanted around my home, so I decided to try my hand at making them instead. I was hooked after my first project so I just never stopped.

I put out a video as well as a written tutorial on all the projects I do to improve my home and workshop. You can find my website at Wilkerdos.com</summary>

  <summary>My name is Mark and I am a graphic designer and photographer by trade, but one of my favorite hobbies is getting out into my shop and building or fixing things. I decided to start this channel because I have often gone online looking for ways to build something, only to come up empty and deciding to figure it out on my own. I am hoping that through my trial and error I can provide others with ideas or inspiration to create their own custom projects.

I am a very busy person and I like it that way. You’ll never find me just sitting around. If I’m not tinkering on things around my house (or at my day job) then I am probably out doing something that I find exciting somewhere in the wilds of Wyoming.</summary>

  <summary>Anyone with an interest in creating things, especially in wood, should find something they enjoy here

I sometimes mix many materials in my creations, and these videos are now branded with the Cre8 logo, so that pure woodies can avoid them ;-)

Some of the techniques I will share with you have been learnt, others I have developed myself and these may be unique. Whether they are the best ways to do things - that's up to you to decide!

  <summary>Making things is what I like to do.  I am going to put build videos on Fridays showing how to make a variety of things.  Wednesdays I do my vlog or "talkie talkie" going over previous builds and talking about general shop stuff.  If you are a builder, maker or DIYer this channel is for you.  Keep up to date by subscribing so you don't miss a thing.  Thanks for stopping by and I'll see you soon!

  <summary>I love designing things..and I tolerate building them.

I'm not the greatest designer, woodworker, film maker, speaker, or anything else. But I think the things I make are pretty decent...and I enjoy them. I hope you'll enjoy them too.

At the very least I hope to entertain you, and at the very most I hope to inspire you. 

Thank you for reading...and happy building!</summary>
