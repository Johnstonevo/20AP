  <summary>A computer video series focusing mainly on retro technology from the 80's, 90's and 2000's. However, once or twice a year I'll create something totally "out there."  My main goal at this point is to make educational content about retro technology that is interesting and engaging.  Some people will be re-living their childhood, while others will be experiencing the technology for the first time.

I'm your host Johnny Millenium and I review forgotten games that not many people know about but should!

Also I will review some big time releases for fun.
I also just love looking back on the golden days of gaming past.

"Other people review games and bash them.
 I just want to review cool games that I think KICK ASS!"

I'm no fanboy of any one system I have them all, I just like good games on any system.

  <summary>Hello!  I am youtuber Boogie2988.  You might know me as Boogie, or as one of my characters... Most notably the raging gamer Francis.  I make vlogs, comedy sketches, video game related news and articles, rage videos, parodies, game play videos, and other gaming videos as well!

    So if you're a gamer looking for gaming videos, gaming news, or gameplay you're in the right place.  If you like watching a fat funny guy named francis destroy gaming consoles and going  on rants and rages then this is the right place for that too!

    I also make serious videos and vlogs about life topics that give advice on a variety of things to help you live a slightly better life and learn from my mistakes about weight loss, or succeeding on youtube, and more!

That's the one! Watch me talk and play (badly) great video games old and new. Yes if everyone else can start YouTube channels about any old nonsense I want to join in!

          I'm not just a fan of your new fangled current games, in 4D and super graphics and what not. I love playing old games too

          I try to bring out 2 videos a week usually, every Monday will be a brand new episode and then Fridays will be my "Let's Complete" series where i try to complete a game

  <summary>Mostly devoted to the base RetroPie image I created called Motion Blue.

The Motion Blue base image is a RetroPie image that has been created and setup with several design goals in mind. Many new scripts and files have been developed to include new features and enhancements.  The base image has been setup and configured for both Emulation Station and Attract Mode will all emulators and romlists/gamelists pre-made.

A design philosophy was adopted for this build to bring RetroPie in line with the current retro gaming community. The most prominent change was to begin using the community standard for filenames for all configuration files and ROM files. This change now has RetroPie matching the EmuMovies/HyperSpin naming convention. With this change, end users are more easily able to download new ROMs and media files that will immediately work, thus saving hours of file renaming.</summary>
