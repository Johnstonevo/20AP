  <summary>A computer video series focusing mainly on retro technology from the 80's, 90's and 2000's. However, once or twice a year I'll create something totally "out there."  My main goal at this point is to make educational content about retro technology that is interesting and engaging.  Some people will be re-living their childhood, while others will be experiencing the technology for the first time.

I'm your host Johnny Millenium and I review forgotten games that not many people know about but should!

Also I will review some big time releases for fun.
I also just love looking back on the golden days of gaming past.

"Other people review games and bash them.
 I just want to review cool games that I think KICK ASS!"

I'm no fanboy of any one system I have them all, I just like good games on any system.

  <summary>Mostly devoted to the base RetroPie image I created called Motion Blue.

The Motion Blue base image is a RetroPie image that has been created and setup with several design goals in mind. Many new scripts and files have been developed to include new features and enhancements.  The base image has been setup and configured for both Emulation Station and Attract Mode will all emulators and romlists/gamelists pre-made.

A design philosophy was adopted for this build to bring RetroPie in line with the current retro gaming community. The most prominent change was to begin using the community standard for filenames for all configuration files and ROM files. This change now has RetroPie matching the EmuMovies/HyperSpin naming convention. With this change, end users are more easily able to download new ROMs and media files that will immediately work, thus saving hours of file renaming.</summary>

I will always offer my help in any way I can and would like a loyal fanbase who would work with me to make this a better place for us all, not just Pewdy bate!
