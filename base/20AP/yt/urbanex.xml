  <summary>Alright Mudlovers! Get close-up and personal with me - a REAL Thames Mudlark. My full permit allows me to search restricted areas on the Thames foreshore that others can't. I aim to meet all kind of mudlarkers at different parts of the Thames to team up, gain knowledge and to find and share with you the awesome artefacts lost over the last 2,000 years in our sacred Father Thames.

  <summary>Mudlarking along the River Thames, London. The River Thames is one of the largest archaeological sites in the world when the tide is out! It has also been used as a rubbish receptacle since London began, by the many civilisations that have lived along its banks.  Mudlarking is a term which has been around since the 16th century, and was originally the word used to describe the poorest of the poor, often young children and old women, who searched the Thames mud for any little bits and pieces that they could sell to make a bob or two. Richer people often used to throw coins down into the Thames mud from the bridges and watch with glee whilst the poor mudlarks scrabbled around for coins. I have been mudlarking in London for almost 15 years now and have a Port of London authority permit. See the Port of London Authority website for details. This youtube channel follows my Thames adventures and the delightful pieces of history, both new and old, that I find in the wonderful River Thames.

<summary>Adventures In Dirt with a metal detector - This is a channel dedicated to chronicling all my adventures in dirt and uncovering lost history.  I love to be outdoors and enjoy the hobby of metal detecting and gold prospecting.  Exploring the area around me and learning about the history of my surrounding communities teaches me about what was.... and with a little luck, maybe I can find what was left behind.  

I am a recreational treasure hunter, gold prospector, metal detectorist, and fan of history.  If you are interested in any of these, please subscribe, I am sure we will get along just fine.  ~DK

<summary>I have been collecting coins ever sense I was 10 years old. It started with my Grandfather giving me silver dollars. Then my Grandmother giving me Chinese coins. Myself looking through my change, looking through rolls, picking up finds at auctions, flea markets, garage sales, coin shows, coin shops and on line. I also collect silver rounds. 
 This Spring 2018 I started Metal Detecting. It is a hobby that quickly became addicting and so much fun. I like to Metal Detect the beach, the woods and all kinds of parks.
 I enjoy watching others show their coin collections and learn from their knowledge. I also enjoy watching others Metal Detect and learn from their years of experience. 
 I want to thank anyone who stops by my page and watches my videos. I appreciate everyone of yous ! 
 Hope you have a wonderful day :-)
